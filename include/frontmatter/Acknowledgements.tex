\section*{Acknowledgements}
Mainly, I want to thank my supervisor, examiner, and teacher Bernhard Mehlig for all the guidance throughout this project who saw promise in it. I would also like to thank Oleksandr Balabanov and Hampus Linander of the department of Physics for all the help and discussions of the results from the simulations, Balaji Lakshminarayanan at Deep mind for clearing out some questions, and a fellow classmate Martin Selin whom I have worked closely and exchanged ideas with. Finally I would also like to thank the professors, IT-Students, and MPCAS students who have contributed handwritten digits to the testing data set used in throughout my thesis.
